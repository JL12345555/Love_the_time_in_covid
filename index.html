  The motivation of our webpage is help Ottawa citizen understand the trend of COVID-19 from 2020-2021; how does lockdown,mandate and vaccines effects trend of COVID-19; the hospitalization rate and icu proportion.
  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  We used COVID-19 Daily cases, Cases in Hospital and Cases in ICU from January, 2020 to December, 2021. Our data are from Open Ottawa, all the data are quantity data.
  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  We determined the time range are 2020-2021, using 3 line chart instead of bar chart to show how daily number effects numbers of hospital and icu; determined the independent variable is date instead of month.
  <br>
</p>
 <p>
   Instruction:<br>
   Filter: there are three checkboxes/options as filters: vaccination, lockdown, and mandate. Each option corresponds to a specific function. When the vaccination box is checked, <br>
   a vertical line will be displayed in the chart to indicate the start time of the vaccination date, When the lockdown is checked, the chart will show the color area of the time period from beginning to end of it. <br>
   The mandate box will use the same pattern as the lockdown does.<br>

Time bar: the time bar under the chart can distinguish different time periods. Users can zoom in and out of the chart by selecting the interval of the time bar. <br>
   When you drag in the time bar, the chart will show the related period. <br>
  </p>

  Design Process:<br>
  We chose the sketch 1 first, but due to the amount of domain, we decided changed to line chart which is sketch 3.
